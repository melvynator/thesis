#Introduction


I do this project in the context of my master thesis done in NTHU (Taiwan). My thesis title is:

####"Hate speech: prediction and diffusion using twitter and graph theory"

I choose this subject because wherever you are looking at in the world you can see that more and more "extremist"
ideology are rising. Hateful are present everywhere on internet. We can take as an example the dailystormer.
During the past 2 years you can see that the number of articles on the dailystormer.com website has almost double.
The particularity of the extrem-right community is that they are very actif on internet and well organized as seen with
the "Shaia leboeuf experiment".

My goal is to implement an algorithm that will be able to predict if someone in contact with a hateful speech will
diffuse it or not.
